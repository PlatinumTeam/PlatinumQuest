# PlatinumQuest

This is the main repository for the public release of the game data and scripts for PQ.

**Under new maintenance** As of mid 2021 (public as of February 2022), a new team is maintaining this project. You can send new pull requests and issues to [their clone of this repository, located here](https://github.com/The-New-Platinum-Team/PlatinumQuest-Dev). ~~As of March 2021, this project is no longer maintained due to a lack of willing maintainers. The repository is preserved as a reference but no further changes are planned to be accepted and no future builds are planned.~~

See [MBExtender](https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MBExtender) for the C++ engine modification source code.

## Running
To run this, you need a copy of the latest game executables. Best source of this is a copy of PQ. This includes any exe/dlls, the `plugins` dir, and `packages/boot.pak`. Or, if you want to build the plugins from source, clone and build [MBExtender](https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MBExtender) and install it into `Marble Blast Platinum`.

## License
MIT License for all PQ script files and shaders. See the headers of individual files for further details.

Assets are released here but not under any license. Contact us if you want to use them for your own purposes.

## Contributing
While there's no formal CLA, your contributions, if included, will also be released here under the MIT license and included in binary form in the game.

There is no linter for Torque Script, but we do have a coding style used throughout the project. Please try to follow it.
